      <h2>v1.0000 - 2 Feburary 2021</h2>
      Summary:
      <ul>
        <li>Originally started out as a test game.</li>
        <li>Added Limit and the gain decrease scaling concept (gain is divided by [limit divided by the difference between number and limit]).</li>
        <li>Implemented the 1st 2 increaser buttons; the limit and gain increasers.
          <ul><li>And the 1%, 10%, 25%, 50%, and 100% increaser buy multipliers to go along with it.</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>Included the 1st 7 upgrades and the 1st 3 unlocks.</li>
        <li>Colour-coding for the upgrade and unlock buttons.
          <ul>
            <li>Green = bought, Light Green = buyable & pointer cursor, Yellow = reachable and Grey = unreachable & not-allowed cursor.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Can 'run' in another tab, through utilising Delta Timing. Also offline progress.</li>
        <li>Number and Settings tabs.</li>
        <li>Simple, bare-bones import/export system. Hovering on the <i>Copy to clipboard</i> button sets the cursor to 'copy'.</li>
        <li>Minor number formatting, but no proper notations.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>v1.0100 - 4 Feburary 2021</h2>
      Summary:
      <ul>
        <li>Nerfed the 7th upgrade, added an upgrade before it and added 2 new upgrades, bringing the total count to 10!<br />Also added a new unlock - the Investing Effectiveness Increaser.</li>
        <li>Added the Investing Effectiveness concept - it multiplies the points invested to the increasers (including itself) for reaching even greater numbers!</li>
        <li>The game now autosaves every second! This is currently toggleable with a setting.</li>
        <li>GDS (Gain Divider Scaling) is now reducible with a Number upgrade.</li>
        <li>Added a progress bar, which illustrates the progress of completion with the upgrades and unlocks. Added a display for the accurate percentage that shows when hovered.</li>
        <li>Added a function to convert older saves to the equivalent save with the up-to-date values.</li>
        <li>Added more cursor stuff.</li>
        <li>Added a few statuses to the top left of the screen.</li>
        <li>Upgrades and unlocks are now initiated purely using JS.</li>
        <li>Minor CSS tweaks.</li>
        <li>And, other minor game (and code) fixes and tag changes.</li>
      </ul>
      <!-- next update: summary: Hard Reset added - now you don't need to open the console to type in "reset()"!-->
